              First step while planning a migration is Assessment. CloudStok
              uses various tools like AWS Discovery and Migration Evaluator
              (Formerly TSO Logic) to create a business case and to identify
              most cost-effective deployment and purchasing options. Our
              Assessment begins with on-premises inventory discovery and
              understanding applications dependencies. We provide an optimized
              business plan to save your cost, optimize performance and give you
              a seamless experience while migrating your workload to cloud.

              Cloud Migration goes way beyond provisioning infrastructure on

              capability of developing enterprise grade applications which
              enables us to understand and execute complex migrations.
